  <h3>Getting Started with Ionic</h3>
  <p>
    This starter project is our way of helping you get a functional
    app running in record time.
  </p>
  <p>
    We've built a number of page templates that you can easily pick and choose
    from depending on the UI you want for your app. If you don't want to use
    certain page designs, simply remove them from the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    To try out the different page designs, swipe over or toggle open the menu and start exploring!
